    - get it writing to a a html canvas
    - and see if you can draw a square on top of it

Then:
    - start reading from the canvas
    - find shapes in the canvas
    - follow the shape in the canvas --> object tracking
    - look into libraries of comparing images (pixels)
    - comparing previous bg image to current image --> creating two layers
        - the layer of difference and the layer of sameness which will be replaced by custom bg
